Why this is ML (not just CV)
This project shows:
Representation learning
Metric learning intuition
Feature space reasoning
Decision thresholds
This is real ML, not just “CNN on dataset”.

--------- not used only tested -----------------
Instead of training a classifier, 
I used a pretrained face embedding model to extract fixed-length feature vectors. 
Face recognition is done by measuring similarity between embeddings, 
which allows adding new identities without retraining.

I built a face recognition system using MediaPipe for face detection and 
landmark-based embedding extraction. Each face is represented as a high-dimensional
embedding vector, and recognition is performed using similarity matching without 
retraining the model. This allows real-time, 
scalable identification with persistent user storage.

-------------- used facenet -------------------
I used cosine similarity on FaceNet embeddings and selected the recognition threshold 
empirically by comparing intra-class and inter-class similarities.

I use a pretrained FaceNet model to extract 128-dimensional embeddings for each detected face.
These embeddings represent identity in a metric space. During inference, 
I compare live embeddings with stored embeddings using cosine similarity and
apply a threshold to decide whether the face matches a known identity or should be marked 
as unknown. This avoids retraining and allows scalable recognition.
