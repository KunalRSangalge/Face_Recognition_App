Why this is ML (not just CV)
This project shows:

Representation learning
Metric learning intuition
Feature space reasoning
Decision thresholds
This is real ML, not just “CNN on dataset”.

Instead of training a classifier, 
I used a pretrained face embedding model to extract fixed-length feature vectors. 
Face recognition is done by measuring similarity between embeddings, 
which allows adding new identities without retraining.
